# Download voters
A Go program to download selected rows and column from the
voter registration data at the NC Board of Elections website
and create an SQLite database file from it.  The data is
updated every Saturday.

## Table of contents
- [File format](#file-format)
- [Program logic](#program-logic)
  - [Initialization:](#initialization) Declare variables and constants.
  - [Step 1:](#step-1) Download the zip file from the website.
  - [Step 2:](#step-2) Create an empty voter database and create the table(s).


## File format
The file at the website is a very large (about 478MB) zip file,
and the CSV file it contains is nearly 4GB, which can make it
hard to manage.  Not all the columns may be of interest, so this
script allows you to select a subset of columns.

The CSV file is tab-delimited.  The layout is described in
https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/data/layout_ncvoter.txt
which I have summarized below:

```
* name:     layout_ncvoter.txt
* purpose:  Contains all legally available voter specific information.
*           Personal identifying information (PII) such as birth date
*           and drivers license number are not included. Voter registrations
*           with a voter_status_desc of 'Removed' are omitted whenever the
*           most recent last voted date is greater than 10 years.
*           This is a weekly point-in-time snapshot current per file date
*           and time.
* updated:  02/11/2022
* format:   tab delimited
* instructions:
*            1) extract using a file archiving and compression program
*               (e.g. WinZip)
*            2) can be linked to ncvhis file by ncid

See the columns map in `main.go` for a list of what I selected as the
columns of interest. You can change this by adding or deleting lines.

## Program logic

### Initialization

Initialize variables and constants. This includes:
- Where to find the zip file, and the name for the text file inside it
- Where to put the output zip file and database
- The required file encoding
- How big a chunk to read from the input stream
- A map of column numbers to names for the columns of interest

### Step 1

Download the latest zip file from the NC state board of
elections website.

#### If the file already exists locally:

- Check whether it is a valid `.zip` file.
If not, this typically means that only part of the file had been downloaded.
- If the file is good:
  - Tell the user we are using an existing file.
  - Get the file size.
  - Skip the download.

#### Otherwise, perform the download:

- Make an HTTP request for the zip file.
- Open the output zip file in `/tmp`.
- Read from the HTTP stream and write to the output zip file:
  - Read a chunk of bytes from the HTTP stream. If the number of bytes is zero, we are done.
  - Write the chunk to the output zip file.
- Return the total number of bytes read.

### Step 2

- Delete the database if it already exists.
- Build the SQL CREATE TABLE statement for the .db file,
using the columns specified in the map.
- Run the SQL to create the `voters` table.
